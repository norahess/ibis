[sea urchin larvae](https://oceanchangereuucsb.com/2018/07/25/guide-on-how-to-spawn-and-experiment-on-urchin-larvae/) 

> They breed around January to March every year. The female sea urchins can produce up to twenty million eggs in one year. When the female sea urchins lay their eggs, the young urchins start off as larvae. It takes a few months for the larvae to develop into small baby sea urchins.

> The spawning incubators are setup to mimic the lunar cycle by providing blue light (peak wavelength at 450 nm, intensity ~10Âµmol photons /mm2s) every 28 days. The blue light is turned on during the 12 hour dark period for the first 5 days of the 28-day cycle. If well-fed and healthy, polyps will likely spawn within the first two 28-day cycles. Spawning typically occurs between days 13 - 20.

**Basic Outline:** 

context

In our changing world, many marine organisms face contact with plastics and microplastics that get washed into their ecosystems. Many plastics have leachates that leak into the water, and thus affect water quality, and in turn [harm many organismal processes](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-022-01369-x). This can have devastating effects on that organisms abundance, overall primary productivity in regions, and alter trophic level systems. Previous microplastic leachate experiments have focused on [ phytoplankton](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-019-0410-x), but little research has been conducted on other organisms, such as bull kelp. Bull kelp is one of Washington's local kelp species and is very important in kelp forests off the coast of the San Juan Islands. These forests provide essential habitat and resources for a diverse array of species, and understanding their response to the presence of leachates in warming oceanic conditions is very crucial, as global warming and increased exposure to plastic and microplastics in our waters continues.

question 

In this experiment, our goals are to understand the relationship of bull kelp's growth rate (growth progression) and the levels of toxic leachates exposed to in different temperature conditions, allowing us to see the effects of leachate presence in current and future oceanic conditions.

methods
In this experiment, I received reproductive bull kelp samples from (INSERT GROUP THAT WE RECEIVE KELP FROM), and induced spawning of the kelp gametophytes. I then placed these kelp gametophytes in well plates, and added different concentrations of plastic leachate to each well dish. To make the plastic leachate, I took a standard source of plastic and blended it with deionized water, and then added that first water sample to a kelp gametophyte well plate. For all other concentrations, water was added 5 times to the solution to dilute the concentrations of leachates that the kelp gametophytes were exposed to. I then placed these kelp gametophytes in 2 heavily controlled refrigerators, with one at 10 C and one being set to 15 C. I let these gametophytes rest in the refrigerator for 1 week and then used an inverted microscope to capture images of the developmental stages of the gametophytes. I continued to capture images weekly of these gametophytes for a month. 


- here we will expose bull kelp gametophytes to increasing concentrations of plastic leachate in a classic ecotoxicology experiment.
- Multiple Stressor experiment: plastic leachates and thermal stress (wine coolers)

hypothesis + anticipated results

In this experiment, I believe those organisms exposed to higher concentrations of plastic leachate will have little to no growth progression, and there will be a maximum tolerance that an organism can withstand and continue to grow properly.

key implications
In Washington, we are already seeing major Bull Kelp decline from various factors. Many restoration efforts are already occuring like the Puget Sound Restoration Refund, so having the knowledge of what leachates and warming temperatures does to kelp will provide better insights to organizations to refine the actions needed to be taken to conserve kelp forests.
- Dramatic Bull Kelp forest declines have been observed in the Puget Sound
- [Puget Sound Restoration Fund](https://restorationfund.org/programs/bullkelp/) has been working to restore bull kelp forests to the Puget Sound
