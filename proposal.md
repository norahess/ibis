[sea urchin larvae](https://oceanchangereuucsb.com/2018/07/25/guide-on-how-to-spawn-and-experiment-on-urchin-larvae/) 

> They breed around January to March every year. The female sea urchins can produce up to twenty million eggs in one year. When the female sea urchins lay their eggs, the young urchins start off as larvae. It takes a few months for the larvae to develop into small baby sea urchins.

[*Nematostella*](https://www.whitney.ufl.edu/media/wwwwhitneyufledu/images/files/Nematostella-laboratory-culture.pdf) starlet sea anemone

> Nematostella populations achieve the greatest densities in the summer. Attempt your collections between May and October

[*Aiptasia*](https://www.protocols.io/view/aiptasia-spawning-and-embryo-larvae-handling-weis-x54v99pmv3eq/v1) sea anemone, Symbiodinacea model system

> The spawning incubators are setup to mimic the lunar cycle by providing blue light (peak wavelength at 450 nm, intensity ~10Âµmol photons /mm2s) every 28 days. The blue light is turned on during the 12 hour dark period for the first 5 days of the 28-day cycle. If well-fed and healthy, polyps will likely spawn within the first two 28-day cycles. Spawning typically occurs between days 13 - 20.

**Basic Outline:** 

In our changing world, many marine organisms are facing contact with microplastics and other toxic pollutants that get washed into marine ecosystems. Many microplastics have leachates that leak into the water, and thus affect water quality, and in turn harm many organismal processes when organisms are exposed to such conditions.
