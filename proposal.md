[sea urchin larvae](https://oceanchangereuucsb.com/2018/07/25/guide-on-how-to-spawn-and-experiment-on-urchin-larvae/) 

> They breed around January to March every year. The female sea urchins can produce up to twenty million eggs in one year. When the female sea urchins lay their eggs, the young urchins start off as larvae. It takes a few months for the larvae to develop into small baby sea urchins.

[*Nematostella*](https://www.whitney.ufl.edu/media/wwwwhitneyufledu/images/files/Nematostella-laboratory-culture.pdf) starlet sea anemone

> Nematostella populations achieve the greatest densities in the summer. Attempt your collections between May and October

[*Aiptasia*](https://www.protocols.io/view/aiptasia-spawning-and-embryo-larvae-handling-weis-x54v99pmv3eq/v1) sea anemone, Symbiodinacea model system

> The spawning incubators are setup to mimic the lunar cycle by providing blue light (peak wavelength at 450 nm, intensity ~10Âµmol photons /mm2s) every 28 days. The blue light is turned on during the 12 hour dark period for the first 5 days of the 28-day cycle. If well-fed and healthy, polyps will likely spawn within the first two 28-day cycles. Spawning typically occurs between days 13 - 20.

> Dependent on FHL access if possible to run using this organism
> Adult kelp plants reach maturity in mid summer, and thus begin to form spori in reproductive efforts. Dessication and cool temperatures can induce releasing of spori in bull kelp species if collected and brought to lab.

**Basic Outline:** 

In our changing world, many marine organisms are facing contact with microplastics and other toxic pollutants that get washed into marine ecosystems. Many microplastics have leachates that leak into the water, and thus affect water quality, and in turn [harm many organismal processes](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-022-01369-x) when organisms are exposed to such conditions. This can have devasting effects on that organisms abundance, overall primary productivity in regions, and alter trophic level systems. In previous microplastic leechate experiments, organisms of interest have been in phytoplankton, but little research has been conducted on other organisms. In this experiment, our goals are to understand the relationship of an organism's growth rate (growth progression) vs the levels of toxic leachates exposed to, allowing us to see the effects of toxic pollutant presence in environments. We will then compare certain concentration regulations of "allowed" toxics to the results of our experiment and others to see the implications of different groups having different tolerances to microplastic leachates. In this experiment, I believe those organisms exposed to higher concentrations of microplastics will have little to no growth progression, and there will likely be a max tolerance that an organism can withstand and continue to grow properly.
