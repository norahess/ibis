# We are offering support for undergraduate student experiential learning opportunities. These experiences could include, but are not limited to, efforts focusing on field work in the Puget Sound Region. Awards will be in the amount of $1000 and will be distributed directly to the student no later than June 01, 2023. Funds could be used at their discretion to support experiential learning opportunities. To apply for funding, faculty should provide a brief summary of the research opportunity including the educational benefit for a student, as well as an explanation of why you feel a given student would be a great candidate for this award. The application should be no longer than two pages and uploaded as a PDF below

## What is the research opportunity?

Nora Hessen has been accepted to study at Friday Harbor Labs (FHL) as part of the Marine Botany course taught by Dr. Wilson Freshwater and Dr. Tom Mumford during this upcoming Summer quarter of 2023. FHL is renowned for its hands-on learning approach in addition to its focus on field and lab work. During the course, Nora will be embarking on her first field experience and conducting her own independent project on seaweeds of the Puget Sound. My Master's graduate student, Sarah Tanja, is mentoring Nora as part of the pilot program, [Identity, Belonging and Inquiry in Science (IBIS)](https://environment.uw.edu/students/current-students/identity-belonging-and-inquiry-in-science-ibis-program/). They plan to work together to develop an experiment and collect data that will be used as an undergraduate research experience for Nora. This research will be presented at the commencement of the course, published in the [Friday Harbor Labs Student Research Papers Archive](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/16338), and made into a poster for the [Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics & Native Americans in Science (SACNAS)](https://www.sacnas.org/conference) conference October 26-28, 2023 in Portland, Oregon.

## Why is Nora a good candidate?

Nora is an excellent candidate for this award; she has shown commitment, responsibility, and discipline in her pursuit of knowledge and skills to further her education and experience in the field of Marine Biology at the University of Washington.

However, as a first-time field scientist, she has yet to build up her 'field-kit' of foul weather gear that is vital both for successful field data collections and for a budding scientists' safety, comfort, and sense of belonging. This award would provide Nora with the necessary funds to purchase boots for tide-pooling, a good-quality rain jacket for working outside in rainy Puget Sound, warm layers, gloves, hats, rite-in-the-rain notebooks, and the myriad other gear items that students are expected to have as per the [student packing list](https://fhl.uw.edu/courses/what-to-expect-at-fhl/student-packing-list/).
