## What is the research opportunity?

Nora Hessen has been accepted to study at Friday Harbor Labs as part of the Marine Botany course taught by Dr. Wilson Freshwater and Dr. Tom Mumford. During the course, Nora will be embarking on her first field experience and conducting her own independent project. My Master's graduate student, Sarah Tanja, is mentoring Nora as part of the pilot Identity Belonging and Inquiry in Science (IBIS) and they plan to work together to develop an experiment and collect data that will be used as an undergraduate research experience for Nora. This research will be presented both at Friday Harbor at the commencement of the course, and at the SACNAS conference in Portland, OR on October 


## Why is Nora a good candidate?

Nora would be a great candidate for this award because she is [ a list of amazing traits and qualities]

As a first-time field scientist, she has yet to build up her 'field-kit' of foul weather gear that is vital for successful field data collections. This award would provide her with the necessary funds
